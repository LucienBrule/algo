## Lab 5: Quick Sort 

Implement the randomized quick sort algorithm described in section 2.4 in the book.
Generate an array of `n >100` random integers in the range `[0,n-1]`.
You should generate these `n` integers independently so that you can have duplicate values
in the array.

Your code should return the sorted array.
