Lab 9: Chain Matrix Multiplication Problem

In this lab you will implement the dynamic programming algorithm to
solve the chain matrix multiplication problem with minimum number of operations.

Given:

- a sequence of
    - matrices A_1,…, A_n
    - dimensions D_0,…,D_n
- where A_i is of dimension D_{i-1} x D_i

Determine the optimal order of multiplications.

Demonstrate your algorithm on this input as well as several other ones to show that it works.

| Matrix | Dimensions |
|--------|------------|
| A_1    | 10x20      |
| A_2    | 20x30      |
| A_3    | 30x40      |
| A_4    | 40x50      |
| A_5    | 50x40      |
| A_6    | 40x10      |
| A_7    | 10x50      |
| A_8    | 50x20      |
