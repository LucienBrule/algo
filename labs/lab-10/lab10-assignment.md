# Lab 10: Linear Programming 

In this lab you are to find a geometric solution to 
a simple LP problem with two variables x1 and x2:

> max x1 + x2 

S.t. 

- 4x1 â€“x2 <= 8 

- 2x1 + x2 <=10 

- 5x1 -2x2 >= -2 

- X1, x2 >=0. 

### Q1: Plot the feasible region 

### Q2: Find the optimum solution 

### Q3: Find an additional constrain that makes this an infeasible problem
