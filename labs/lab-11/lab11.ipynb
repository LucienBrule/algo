    "\n",
    "To implement a polynomial time algorithm for this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Create an empty solution set (selected_subsets).\n",
    "2. While there are still uncovered elements in the range 1 to n:\n",
    "    a. Select the subset s(i) from S with the maximum number of uncovered elements.\n",
    "    b. Add s(i) to the solution set (selected_subsets).\n",
    "    c. Remove the elements of s(i) from the uncovered elements.\n",
